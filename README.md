## Micha≈Ç Nowotnik

**Software developer and consultant** üíª

Enthusiastic about automating boring processes and leveraging
machines to make our work faster and lives more pleasant.

## Open source projects

I think the culture in the open-source community of sharing one's work
with others for no cost is a noble endeavor. Especially given that
creating even a simple software package takes a little while.

I'm just getting started, so this section is not overly crowded.
Currently, I am interested in improving the speed of working on a computer:
be it taking notes or using terminal.
